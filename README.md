# AffineCipher
Affine Cipher project protect your messages from attacker and make attacking  process difficult and if the attacker could hacking you it makes your messages  inexplicable to unauthorized reader , the program make some steps to convert the  messages “plain text” to inexplicable text “cipher text”. (1) get the message “plain  text” from program user. (2) get both keys “key a “and “key b” from program user  these keys used in “Encrypt Method” and “Decrypt Method”. (3) check the “key  a“has an inverse key or not if hasn’t “Encrypt Method” will not make until the user  enter key has inverse. (4) Encryption is made, and the output called “cipher text”. And we can reconvert the “cipher text” to the original message “plain text” the  program makes that by some steps: (1) get the cipher text that outputted from “Encrypt method”. (2) get same keys from Encrypt Activity. (3) Decryption is  done, and the output is the original message..
